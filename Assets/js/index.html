    <h1>Public Speaking Tips for Students</h1>
    <h2>Self Awareness</h2>
    <p>“You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.”The two kinds of self-awareness are private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is a moment of realization that only involves yourself. This could look like realizing you have feelings for someone when you return home from a date. Public self-awareness is the ability to understand how others perceive you and usually follows social norms. Ensuring you practice your valedictorian speech so you don't make a mistake is a form of public self-awareness.Self-awareness is the ability to recognize you are separate from other people, while also assessing your own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. To be self-aware means you can use your senses and experiences to understand your emotions and help you make future choices.</p>

    <h2>Self-esteem</h2>
    <p>elf-esteem is your subjective sense of overall personal worth or value. Similar to self-respect, it describes your level of confidence in your abilities and attributes.Having healthy self-esteem can influence your motivation, your mental well-being, and your overall quality of life. However, having self-esteem that is either too high or too low can be problematic. Better understanding what your unique level of self-esteem is can help you strike a balance that is just right for you.</p>
    <p>Self-esteem tends to be lowest in childhood and increases during adolescence, as well as adulthood, eventually reaching a fairly stable and enduring level. This makes self-esteem similar to the stability of personality traits over time.</p>

   <h2>Self Talk</h2>
   <p>Self-talk is the way you talk to yourself, or your inner voice. You might not be aware that you're doing it but you almost certainly are. This inner voice starts from the time you wake up until the time you go to bed and can help you: process experiences.Self-talk is important because it has a big impact on how you feel, what you do and even how you manage pain. It can be supportive and motivate you, or it can be negative and lower your confidence.</p>
   <p>What are the benefits of positive self-talk?</p>
   <p> If you mainly think positively about yourself, you will feel good and optimistic most of the time. Research shows that positive self-talk can:</p>

   <h2>Fear</h2>
   <p>Fear is an intensely unpleasant primal emotion in response to perceiving or recognizing a danger or threat. Fear causes psychological changes that may produce behavioral reactions such as mounting an aggressive response or fleeing the threat. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to oneself Fear arises with the threat of harm, either physical, emotional, or psychological, real or imagined. If your fear is significant enough to cause problems in work, school, or in social settings, then it is possible that you suffer from a full-blown phobia. Because of how often the skill of public speaking is required in our daily life, this phobia can be very debilitating. Even ordering a coffee can feel like an impossibility. It can take a lot of practice and experience to overcome, but many people are able to manage and control the fear.
     You may never be comfortable enough to speak on camera, but it is more than possible for you to at least become comfortable in social and professional situations where you may be required to speak</p>

   <p>Communication is a learned skill. However, while most people are born with the physical ability to talk, not all can communicate well unless they make special
   efforts to develop and refine this skill further. Very often, we take the ease with which we communicate with each other for granted, so much so that we sometimes forget how complex the communication process actually is.</p>
   
      <h2>Elements in Communication </h2>
      <p>Have you ever wondered why some people can communicate so well while others fail to get their message across? What are the elements that must be present in the communication process before it can be successful and effective? Well, communication has been defined as the act of giving, receiving orexchanging information, ideas and opinions so that the „message‰ is completely understood by both parties. Look at Figure 1.1 below. The illustration shows clearly that in a communication process, there must be a sender who speaks or sends a message, and a receiver who listens or receives the message.

        <p>The sender sends a message with a certain intention in mind. The receiver of the message tries to understand and interpret the message sent. He then gives feedback to the original sender, who in turn interprets the feedback. This process, repeated continuously, constitutes communication. Clearly, there are several major elements in the communication process ă sender, message, channel, receiver, feedback, context. There is both a speakerÊs intention to convey a message and a listenerÊs reception of what has been said. Thus, listening skills are just as important as speaking skills in order for communication to be effective. </p>

<h2> Public Speaking and Presentation Skills</h2>
<p>Public speaking is the art of transferring knowledge from one person to another. It is mostly used to motivate and encourage the audience. According to some experts, public speaking requires only the skills of a speaker to present themselves verbally with different communication styles among the live audience and entertain them.On the other hand, presentation skill requires an individual to combine their verbal skills with writing abilities. It requires an individual to work on visuals such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, or any other applications.</p>
   
<p>People often think that public speaking and presentation skills are the same thing and use it interchangeably. After all, public speaking and presentation require you to give a speech in front of an audience. However, this is not the case as there are subtle differences between the two skills. It is advisable to understand the differences to prepare accordingly. This will give you the best results.On the other hand, public speaking is defined as the skill to speak effectively and confidently in front of a large crowd. In public speaking, you can share your life experiences to educate the crowd about certain situations. You entertain them with your body language and facial expressions. You perform in a way so that the mass enjoys hearing you and pays attention to your every word.You might have observed how a chief guest or organization leader can hook the audience to their seats with their speech and style. It is considered an art so you have to be an artist to draw the attention of the crowd toward you.</p>
   
<h3>motivation</h3>
<p>Motivation is an important part of psychology. It is the driving force by which people (or animals) get what they want. A motive is the reason for an action taken.Motivation arouses a person to act towards a desired goal. It is a driving force which promotes action. For example, hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat. "Motivation is an energizer of behavior".[1] It is the purpose or psychological cause of an action.[2] With animals, motivation is caused by basic needs: needs for food, water, warmth, safety, mating, protecting the young, defending territory, needs to escape pain and threats... The drive to do these things is instinctive, inborn, and triggered by circumstance. With humans, whose mental life is much more complex, motivation is more complicated. Obviously, humans feel the need for food and water, avoid pain and so on. But they are also capable of having long-term plans which are more difficult to understand.</p>
